\title{Snowbot: An empirical study of building chatbot using seq2seq with different framework}

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two
% commands used to separate the names and addresses of multiple
% authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to
% break the lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So,
% if LaTeX puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last
% on the second line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third
% author name.

% \nipsfinalcopy is no longer used

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    The abstract paragraph should be indented \nicefrac{1}{2}~inch
    (3~picas) on both the left- and right-hand margins. Use 10~point
    type, with a vertical spacing (leading) of 11~points. The word
    \textbf{Abstract} must be centered, bold, and in point size 12. Two
    line spaces precede the abstract. The abstract must be limited to
    one paragraph.
\end{abstract}

\section{Background}

Chatbot is really popular

\subsection{Style}

The file \verb+nips_2017.tex+ may be used as a ``shell'' for writing
your paper. All you have to do is replace the author, title, abstract,
and text of the paper with your own.

The formatting instructions contained in these style files are
summarized in Sections~\ref{sec:model}.

\section{Model}
\label{sec:model}


\section{Dataset}
\label{sec:dataset}

Cornell Movie Dialog Corpus~\cite{data:cornell}

\subsection{Headings: second level}

Second-level headings should be in 10-point type.

\subsubsection{Headings: third level}

Third-level headings should be in 10-point type.

\paragraph{Paragraphs}

There is also a \verb+\paragraph+ command available, which sets the
heading in bold, flush left, and inline with the text, with the
heading followed by 1\,em of space.

\section{Frameworks}
\label{sec:frameworks}

These instructions apply to everyone.

\subsection{Figures}

All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark
enough for purposes of reproduction. The figure number and caption
always appear after the figure. Place one line space before the figure
caption and one line space after the figure. The figure caption should
be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); figures are
numbered consecutively.

You may use color figures. However, it is best for the figure
captions and the paper body to be legible if the paper is printed in
either black/white or in color.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
    \caption{Sample figure caption.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Tables}

All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible. The table
number and title always appear before the table. See
Table~\ref{sample-table}.

Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the
table title, and one line space after the table. The table title must
be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); tables are
numbered consecutively.

Note that publication-quality tables \emph{do not contain vertical
rules.} We strongly suggest the use of the \verb+booktabs+ package,
which allows for typesetting high-quality, professional tables:
\begin{center}
    \url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs}
\end{center}
This package was used to typeset Table~\ref{sample-table}.

\begin{table}[t]
    \caption{Sample table title}
    \label{sample-table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{lll}
        \toprule
        \multicolumn{2}{c}{Part}                   \\
        \cmidrule{1-2}
        Name & Description & Size ($\mu$m) \\
        \midrule
        Dendrite & Input terminal & $\sim$100     \\
        Axon & Output terminal & $\sim$10      \\
        Soma & Cell body & up to $10^6$  \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
