\section{Abstract}

Machine learning frameworks is now a new competing spot for tech giants,
especially cloud service providers with GPU or TPU\footnote{https://cloud.google.com/tpu/} support.
Main stream frameworks are all backed by companies,
Google created tensorflow, Amazon chose MXNet, Facebook created PyTorch and Microsoft built CNTK.
Though they are working on open format neural network format ONNX\footnote{http://onnx.ai/},
the cost of implementing and running same model using different framework on different cloud still varies.

We chose to build a chatbot using seq2seq in the experiment,
though it's hard to evaluate performance of a dialogue system\cite{liu2016not}.
It's close related to previous course projects and our main goal is to explore different frameworks
instead of reach good score in a well defined problem.
Also we plan to use it as a base for building a personal knowledge manage assistant in the future.

\section{Background}

Chatbot can be generally divided into two types,
one that answers randomly, or use single answer for almost everything.
Jokes aside, most bot that being used in real life are normally restricted to a very specific domain,
and requires a lot of heuristic rules, in which case a good knowledge base is more important than the learner.
Like booking a plane ticket, providing bus schedule.
Though kind of restricted, as long as you have the data and the problem well defined,
they won't come up with random answers that makes human user confuse, because the answer
is picked or trained from existing conversations and human interacting with those bot
know their purpose before they start chatting.

However, sometimes human don't have a exact purpose when talk to a bot, they many not know the exact question at all.
Take StackOverflow for example, a lot of question are asked because the
OP does not how to look at their error message to find the exact problem and google it.
The ability to narrow down a program requires a lot of experience in certain field,
it might takes a human decades to become an expert, because human can't scale out.
Working 24h a day can only decrease productivity if not killing the man, and adding
more man can't increase it as well because human can't share their mind directly like computer share bits.
Also human are much harder to schedule.

Thus a open domain (or semi-open domain) bot is much useful, it can help people
discover things they didn't know instead of just save some typing.
