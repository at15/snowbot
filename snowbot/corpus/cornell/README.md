## Preprocess

- [#15](https://github.com/at15/snowbot/issues/15) after observing the file, I found I am splitting QA in the wrong way, [L1, L2, L3] does not mean [u1, u2, u3]
  - https://github.com/b0noI/dialog_converter seems to be doing it the right way, I initially though he didn't find the conversation file
